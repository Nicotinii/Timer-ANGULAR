# Timer Angular

Welcome to my EMOM timer project built with Angular!  
This is a personal project that I created to demonstrate my skills in web development using Angular. 

EMOM, or Every Minute On the Minute, is a popular workout protocol used in CrossFit and other fitness programs.  
My timer allows you to easily set up and customize EMOM workouts to suit your needs. With a sleek and intuitive interface, you can quickly set the duration, the number of rounds, and other parameters.   
I also included helpful features like sound and visual cues to keep you on track and motivated throughout your workout.  

Whether you're a seasoned athlete or just starting out, my Angular EMOM timer is the perfect tool to help you crush your fitness goals.
